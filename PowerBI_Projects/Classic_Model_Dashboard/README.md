-Classic Model Dashboard-

Tools: SQL, Excel, PowerBI

Dataset Source: MySQL DB

Objective:

Create a dashboard that shows two main view:

  1. The first page will show two main KPIs; sales and net profit, which will be displayed into some categorization, which is product line, cost of sale, country of office, and country of customer. It would also displays the total sales, count of unique orders, and average value of each order.
     
  2. The second page will show net profit decomposition into: customer country -> product line -> customer name. It would also displays the sales overview from 2003 to 2005.

Key Insights:

  • Identified Classic Cars as the primary profit driver

  • Discovered profit concentration in USA and France

  • Analyzed cost vs profit efficiency
  
Skills Demonstrated: SQL joins, data cleaning, dashboard design, KPI analysis

In this project, I built a PowerBI dashboard on some classic model sales. There, I displayed monthly sales, MoM % change, sales and net profit buttons to switch between sales and net profit view. Some visuals that I include are column charts, donut chart, bar chart, and scatter plot as well as line charts and KPI cards.
