In this project, after collecting the dataset, first of all I cleaned the dataset by trimming blank spaces, handling blanks and repivoting the data to be able to split each cast member, director, etc. into new sheets so they can be identified with a unique key. Then, I cleaned the data using Excel. I also have analyzed the data in Excel with PivotTables and some VLookups.
