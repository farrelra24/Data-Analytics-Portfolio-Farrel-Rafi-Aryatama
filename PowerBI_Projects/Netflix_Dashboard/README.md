  • Found TV-MA content dominates, indicating adult-focused audience targeting
  
  • Discovered international movies as the largest genre, highlighting Netflix’s global expansion strategy

Skills Demonstrated: SQL joins, data cleaning, dashboard design, KPI analysis

In this project, I've built a Netflix dashboard. After collecting the dataset, first I cleaned the dataset by trimming blank spaces, handling blanks and repivoting the data to be able to split each cast member, director, etc. into new sheets so they can be identified with a unique key. Then, I cleaned the data using Excel. I also have analyzed the data in Excel with PivotTables and some VLookups.
